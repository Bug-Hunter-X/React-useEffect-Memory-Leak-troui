This React component utilizes the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API. However, it neglects to include a cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook. This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior when the component unmounts.  The component will continue to fetch data even after it's no longer displayed, leading to wasted resources and potential errors.
